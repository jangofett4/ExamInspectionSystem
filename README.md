# Exam Inspection System
This is a project aimed to ease lecturer exam inspection by automating exam reading and result calcultion processes. 
Project is currently released and mostly stable, but you might expect some bugs, we don't have any testers. 
Currently this project uses SQLite for database, reason behind this is: 
- SQLite is fast
- SQLite is portable
- SQLite is small

## Platforms
Currently this application can only run on Windows machines, due to restrictions of WPF. No linux release is planned currently.

## Installation
Go to [releases](https://github.com/jangofett4/ExamInspectionSystem/releases) and grab the latest setup file. 
If you installed this application before, remove it from control panel and install the latest version. Don't worry, you won't lose your data. 
Newly installed version will automatically convert old data if format is changed and notify you of changes.

## Performance
This application is optimized to the very core. Application may run rough at start, but will run smoothly after a while. 
Application should never use no more than 1GiB of ram at once. 
Recommended System Requirements: 
- Memory: 2GiB
- Hard Drive Space: 50MiB

Note: As the data gets added, database will grow.
